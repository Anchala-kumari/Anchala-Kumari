### 🚀 Career Journey: Mainframe → Data Science

I began my professional journey working on enterprise mainframe systems, gaining hands-on experience with large-scale, mission-critical applications and structured data processing. While working in this environment, I developed a strong interest in how data can be transformed into insights and intelligent solutions.

To deepen this interest, I completed comprehensive training in Data Science and started building hands-on projects using Python, Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision. I have worked on projects such as resume parsing, image detection, and NLP applications using Hugging Face models.

I bring together enterprise system thinking from my mainframe background with modern Data Science and AI techniques to build scalable, real-world solutions.
